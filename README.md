# Drawing pad
Drawing-pad project done for TOP. Similar to an Etch-a-sketch.

Neat little project centered around DOM manipulation. It was also a great opportunity to brush up on past knowledge and learn more about styling.

Features include:
 - Clear grid button
 - Eraser
 - Random color option
 - Resizable canvas (up to 100px)
